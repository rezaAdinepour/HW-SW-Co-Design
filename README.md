# Simple HW/SW Co-design of LED on Zynq

This repository contains a simple hardware/software co-design project demonstrating how to control an LED using the **Processing System (PS)** and **Programmable Logic (PL)** on a Xilinx Zynq SoC. This project serves as an introductory example for understanding and working with Zynq platforms.

## Description

In this project:
- The **Processing System (PS)** is used to initialize and control the LED.
- The **Programmable Logic (PL)** handles the hardware configuration for LED operation.

The implementation is based on two tutorial videos that explain step-by-step how to work with both the PS and PL on a Zynq SoC. 

### Reference Tutorials:
1. **Part 1**: [Introduction to PS and PL on Zynq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_odNhKOZjEo)  
   Explains the basics of integrating the PS and PL in a Zynq SoC.
2. **Part 2**: [Controlling LEDs with HW/SW Co-design on Zynq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOy5l36DroY&t=0s)  
   Shows the practical implementation of controlling an LED using HW/SW co-design.
